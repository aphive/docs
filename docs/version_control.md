# Version Control

## What is Version Control?

Version control is at it's basic, the practice of keeping track of changes to files. Have you ever had or still have files with names like `FileName_rev1`, `FileName_rev2`, `FileName_final` then you are practicing version control. A crude version of it, but it is version control. This practice could leave you with tens or hundreds of files and it's not easy to work in a collaborative environment.

As per Git:
> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Why use a VCS (Version Control System)?

As noted above, having to keep many multiple files as you make changes to your doc is difficult to maintain and tracking what changes were made in each file without having to open each doc and reading through and comparing it to your current final version. See how this is already looking like a difficult mess to maintain?

With a Version Control system you would have one file to maintain with a timeline of changes, this allows you to not only see when changes were made but what changes were made to the file. Each file in your VCS has it's own timeline so even so you can track each individually.

## Why Git?
While there is a wide selection of systems to choose from, Git is the more commonly used system used today. Git is a free and open source version control system. Everything in git is checksummed with a SHA-1 hash before it is stored

> Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

Git manages your files in a directory like structure called repositories and branches, the combination allows for granular timelines and ease for multiple people to work on the same file via git commits.
