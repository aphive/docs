Cron is a time based job scheduler in Unix-like Operating Systems. People who use and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. Cron is driven by a crontab (cron table) file that specifies shell commands to run periodically on the given schedules. Crontab files normally reside in the same location as the cron daemon. Individuaals can choose to have their own crontab files. These normally reside in the /etc directory. Crontab A crontab file contains instructions for the cron daemon in the form of \"run this command at this time on this date\" . Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be executed as the user who owns the crontab. Crontab Layout Each line of a crontab file represents a job, and looks like this: +------------------- minute (0-59) | +---------------- hour (0-23) | | +------------- day of month (1-31) | | | +---------- month (1-12) | | | | +------- day of week (0-6) (Sunday to Saturday) | | | | | | | | | | * * * * * command_to_execute Expressions Field Required Allowed Values Allowed Special Characters Minutes Yes 0-50 * , , , - Hours Yes 0-23 * , , , - Day of Month Yes 1-32 * , , , - Month Yes 1-12 * , , , - Day of Week Yes 0-6 * , , , - Asterisk The ( * ) character specifies all possible values for the field. Example: 10 * 1 1 * will run the command at minute 10 every hour on the first day in January or at 2021-01-01 00:10:00 Comma The ( , ) character defines a list. Example: MON,WED,FRI in the 5 th field will tell the command to run on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Round The ( # ) pound character defines a comment. Example: # This command does something somewhere. Step Values Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range with /<number> specifies skips of the number's value through the range. Example: 0-23/2 in the 2 nd field denotes every other hour. Example Cron File # Run five minutes after midnight each day 5 0 * * * /path/to/script # Run at 10pm on workdays and email John 0 22 * * 1 -5 mail -s \"Something Important\" john # Run this one as root 5 0 * * * root touch /tmp/file General Overview Cron basics If this in your first time using cron, you will be prompted to choose an editor, the prompt will list your options and it will vary depending on which editor you have installed, for example: no crontab for user - using an empty one Select an editor.

It is quite possible the RSA algorithm will become practically breakable in the foreseeable future. All SSH clients support this algorithm. dsa - an old US government Digital Signature Algorithm.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Once the key is generated, you will see an output like this: Generating public/private ecdsa key pair. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /home/user_name/.ssh/id_ecdsa Your public key has been saved in /home/user_name/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub The key fingerprint is: SHA256:vEcqEgn2oHbtJkV5Niscgd1SZKDC6UpURuy5n4Iva4Q message The key's randomart image is: +---[ECDSA 521]---+ | o+oo=+ | |. +o.o+. | | ==..+.+ | |oo.*+.+.o | |o+ .== .S . | |E...o.. + | |o ..ooo o . | | + .o+ . . | |..+.. | +----[SHA256]-----+ Warning The process you just went through will create a set of two keys for each one you generate as follows: id_ecdsa - your private key. DO NOT share this with anyone. id_ecdsa.pub - your public key. Only share this key. That's it, you have SSH Keys that you can use where needed.

Version control is at it's basic, the practice of keeping track of changes to files. Have you ever had or still have files with names like FileName_rev1 , FileName_rev2 , FileName_final then you are practicing version control. A very crude version of it, but it is version control. This practice could leave you with tens or hundreds of files; also, it's not easy to tell differences between files or work in a collaborative environment. As per Git: Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Why use a VCS (Version Control System)? As noted above, having to keep many multiple files as you make changes to your doc is difficult to maintain. Tracking your changes across each file is impossible without having to open each file, reading through and comparing it to your current final version then repeating this process through as many other files you saved. See how this is already looking like a difficult mess to maintain and that is only on your ? With a VCS system controlling your project, you have one set of individual files to maintain with a single timeline; this allows you to not only see who made changes and when, but also what changes were made to each individual file since each file in your VCS has it's own timeline. As you can see, using a VCS like Git, allows you to have a clean project with single files that have their own individual timeline. Why Git? Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. While there is a wide selection of systems to choose from, Git is the more commonly used system today. Git is a free and open source version control system. Everything in git is checksummed with a SHA-1 hash before it is stored. Git manages your files in a directory like structure called repositories and branches, the combination allows for granular timelines and ease for multiple people to work on the same file via git commits.","title":"Intro to Version Control"},{"location":"version_control/#version-control","text":"","title":"Version Control"},{"location":"version_control/#what-is-version-control","text":"Version control is at it's basic, the practice of keeping track of changes to files.
